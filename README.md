# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This repository contains files used for the final project for BMIN503. It contains a template for the project, a completed qmd file with code, and an html file of the same code.

My project uses census data as predictors and PLACES data as health outcomes, and investigates whether the Area Deprivation Index can be optimized for 2020 Pennsylvania tracts.
